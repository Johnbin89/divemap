* Implement a system for parsing dive store newsletters to extract and display upcoming dive trip information on an interactive map.  
* Provide contact mechanisms for users to book dives with centers.  
* Enable users to log and track their personal dives with detailed information.
* Allow users to claim ownership of diving centers with admin approval.
* Design for scalability and future expansion to a mobile application.

* Scalable deployment infrastructure (Docker/Kubernetes).  
* User-friendly UI/UX improvements.

### **Phase 8: Mobile Application (Future)**

* Design and development of the React Native mobile application.  
* Adaptation of existing frontend components.  
* Mobile-specific features (e.g., location services for "dives near me").

## **10\. Security Considerations**

* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication + Google OAuth.  
* **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between regular users, administrators, and moderators.  
* **Password Hashing:** Use strong, industry-standard hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) with salts.  
* **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).  
* **CORS:** Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.  
* **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication.  
* **Rate Limiting:** Protect against brute-force attacks and API abuse.  
* **Secret Management:** Securely store API keys and sensitive credentials (e.g., environment variables, dedicated secret management services).  
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
* **Google OAuth Security:** Secure token verification with Google's servers.
* **Media Upload Security:** Validate file types and sizes, scan for malware.

## **11\. Error Handling and Logging**

* Implement centralized error logging (e.g., using Sentry, ELK stack).  
* Provide meaningful error messages to the client without exposing sensitive internal details.  
* Log sufficient information for debugging (request details, stack traces, timestamps).  
* Graceful degradation for external service failures.

## **12\. Testing Infrastructure**

### **12.1 Testing Strategy**

* **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive test suite for backend API endpoints using Pytest.
* **Frontend Validation:** Automated scripts to validate frontend functionality and catch regressions.
* **Data Type Safety:** Validation of API response types and frontend data handling.
* **Regression Prevention:** Automated testing to prevent common frontend errors.

### **12.2 Testing Tools**

* **Backend Testing:** Pytest with fixtures for isolated test database and authentication.
* **Frontend Validation:** Node.js scripts for API health checks and data type validation.
* **Regression Testing:** Automated scripts to test common issues like data type mismatches.
* **Manual Testing:** Comprehensive checklist for user experience validation.

### **12.3 Test Categories**

#### **A. Backend API Testing**
* Unit tests for all API endpoints (auth, users, dive sites, diving centers, dives)
* Integration tests for database operations
* Authentication and authorization testing
* Error handling and edge case testing
* Google OAuth testing

#### **B. Frontend Validation**
* Data type validation (lat/lng as strings, ratings as numbers)
* API endpoint connectivity testing
* Common error prevention (array safety, type conversion)
* User interface functionality testing
* Google OAuth integration testing

#### **C. Regression Prevention**
* Automated testing for common frontend errors
* Data type safety validation
* API parameter filtering testing
* Cross-browser compatibility testing

### **12.4 Testing Commands**

```bash
# Backend tests
