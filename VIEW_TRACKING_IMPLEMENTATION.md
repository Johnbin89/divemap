# View Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of view tracking for dive sites and diving centers in the Divemap application. View counts are tracked for each dive site and diving center, but are only displayed to admin users in the admin interface.

## Database Changes

### Migration
- **File**: `backend/migrations/versions/0004_add_view_count_fields.py`
- **Changes**: Added `view_count` column to both `dive_sites` and `diving_centers` tables
- **Default Value**: 0 (non-nullable)

### Model Updates
- **File**: `backend/app/models.py`
- **Changes**: Added `view_count` field to both `DiveSite` and `DivingCenter` models

## API Changes

### Schema Updates
- **File**: `backend/app/schemas.py`
- **Changes**: Added `view_count` field to `DiveSiteResponse` and `DivingCenterResponse` schemas
- **Note**: View count is only included for admin users

### Router Updates

#### Dive Sites Router (`backend/app/routers/dive_sites.py`)
1. **GET `/dive-sites/{id}`**: 
   - Increments view count on each request
   - Only includes view_count in response for admin users

2. **GET `/dive-sites/`**:
   - Only includes view_count in response for admin users

#### Diving Centers Router (`backend/app/routers/diving_centers.py`)
1. **GET `/diving-centers/{id}`**:
   - Increments view count on each request
   - Only includes view_count in response for admin users

2. **GET `/diving-centers/`**:
   - Only includes view_count in response for admin users

## Frontend Changes

### Admin Pages
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminDiveSites.js`
- **Changes**: Added "Views" column to display view counts for admin users

- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminDivingCenters.js`
- **Changes**: Added "Views" column to display view counts for admin users

### Display Format
- View counts are displayed with proper number formatting using `toLocaleString()`
- Shows "N/A" if view count is not available

## Security & Privacy

### Admin-Only Access
- View counts are only included in API responses for authenticated admin users
- Non-admin users cannot see view counts in any API responses
- View counts are properly hidden from public interfaces

### View Tracking Logic
- View counts are incremented on each GET request to individual dive site or diving center details
- View counts are not incremented for list endpoints (to avoid artificial inflation)
- Each unique visit to a detail page increments the view count by 1

## Testing

### Backend Tests
- All existing tests continue to pass
- View tracking functionality is tested through manual verification

### Frontend Validation
- Frontend validation passes
- Admin pages properly display view count columns

### Regression Tests
- All regression tests pass
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Usage

### For Admin Users
1. Navigate to Admin → Dive Sites or Admin → Diving Centers
2. View the "Views" column to see view counts for each item
3. View counts are displayed with proper formatting (e.g., "1,234")

### For Regular Users
- View counts are completely hidden from regular users
- No changes to user experience
- View counts are still tracked in the background

## Database Verification

### Current View Counts
As of implementation:
- Great Barrier Reef - Outer Reef: 4 views
- Cairns Dive Center: 4 views
- Other items: 0 views (as expected for new implementation)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create detailed analytics showing view trends
2. **View History**: Track when views occurred (timestamp)
3. **Unique Views**: Track unique visitors vs total views
4. **View Analytics**: Add charts and graphs for view statistics
5. **Export Functionality**: Allow admins to export view statistics

### Implementation Notes
- View tracking is lightweight and doesn't impact performance
- Database indexes on view_count could be added if needed for sorting
- View counts are automatically incremented without user intervention
- No additional authentication required for view tracking

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/app/models.py` - Added view_count fields
- `backend/app/schemas.py` - Added view_count to response schemas
- `backend/app/routers/dive_sites.py` - Updated endpoints for view tracking
- `backend/app/routers/diving_centers.py` - Updated endpoints for view tracking
- `backend/migrations/versions/0004_add_view_count_fields.py` - Database migration

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/pages/AdminDiveSites.js` - Added Views column
- `frontend/src/pages/AdminDivingCenters.js` - Added Views column

### Testing
- `test_view_tracking.js` - Custom test script for view tracking verification
- `VIEW_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

## Conclusion

The view tracking implementation is complete and functional. View counts are properly tracked, stored, and displayed only to admin users. The implementation maintains security and privacy while providing valuable analytics for administrators.
