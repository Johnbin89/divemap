## Development

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (for local development and testing)
- Python 3.11+ (for local development)

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
docker-compose exec backend python -m pytest

# Frontend validation
node validate_frontend.js

# Regression testing
node test_regressions.js
```

### Database
The application uses MySQL for data storage. The database is automatically initialized with sample data when the containers start.

### Database Migrations
Database schema changes are managed using Alembic migrations:

```bash
# Run migrations manually
cd backend
source divemap_venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="/home/kargig/src/divemap/backend/divemap_venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH"

# Create new migration
python create_migration.py "Description of changes"

# Run migrations
python run_migrations.py

# Check migration status
alembic current
alembic history
```

**Note**: Migrations run automatically before the backend starts in Docker containers.

### Data Population
After running migrations, populate diving organizations with initial data:

```bash
# Populate diving organizations
cd backend
source divemap_venv/bin/activate
python populate_diving_organizations.py

# List diving organizations
python populate_diving_organizations.py list
```
